   What do process optimization and document management systems have in common?
   Both share the same goal: improving efficiency and productivity within organizations. Process optimization focuses on analyzing and enhancing workflows, while a DMS improves the handling of documents and information, which is often an integral part of business processes.
   The long-term goal of efficiency is task automation. Process optimization can lead to the automation of repetitive tasks, allowing an organization to save time and resources. With a DMS, tasks like invoice processing can already be automated. A document workflow can be set up to manage the process from approval to archiving.
   To achieve a complete improvement in an organization’s way of working, process optimization and a DMS can work synergistically. Implementing a DMS can be an integral part of a broader approach to process optimization.

   Employment law
   Disputes in the workplace can arise quickly – whether due to termination, outstanding salary payments, or expense claims. With employment legal protection from Protekta, you’re on the safe side.
   Example 1
   You dismiss an underperforming member of staff. This staff member retains the services of a lawyer, who asserts that the dismissal was wrongful and the certificate of employment should be amended to reflect this.
   Example 2
   Your employee submits an inflated expense report. She also demands payment of overtime. You try to start a conversation but she threatens to initiate a conciliation procedure.
   
   Landlord-tenant law
   Whether it’s a termination, rent adjustment, or construction-related disruptions – conflicts involving your commercial lease or rental agreements can put a strain on your business. Protekta’s legal protection insurance helps you assert your rights.
   Example 1
   You have rented a warehouse for your company. The owner terminates the lease inside the contractual notice period, stating that they need the property for personal use. You are worried that you will not be able to find new premises in time. You would like to enforce an extension.
   Example 2
   Your landlord is renovating the façade of your commercial let. This restricts access to your premises and causes your sales revenues to fall. Your landlord is not prepared to discuss solutions with you.
   
   Comprehensive cover
   Legal disputes can arise in many areas of your business – whether in commercial dealings, road traffic, or real estate matters. With Protekta’s comprehensive legal protection, you’re thoroughly covered.
   Business legal protection
   A supplier sends you an inflated invoice. A customer requests a price reduction due to alleged defects. A local resident alleges that noise pollution is originating from your business. One of your employees claims overtime that they have not actually worked. Protekta’s business legal protection covers disputes relating to your company’s business.
   Motor legal protection
   This covers purchases, leases and vehicle repairs as well as road accidents, licence confiscations or vehicle tax disputes. We support you in cases involving traffic and vehicle-related incidents.
   Real estate legal protection
   If you are a buy-to-let landlord, real estate legal protection helps you with disputes relating to properties that you own but do not use or live in (such as buildings, apartments or parking spaces).
   Examples include if your tenant refuses to vacate the premises after you have given notice, or if your buildings insurance company refuses to pay for storm damage.

   1. Preparation
   After an initial analysis and goal definition, we clean up your financial data and conduct a market-based company valuation. Together, we define a realistic sale price to be communicated. Following the creation of a compelling company profile, we conduct a discreet business tour. It is essential to us that we know and understand your company in detail, as only then can we credibly represent your business to potential buyers in the first instance.
   
   2. Buyer Outreach
   Every company has unique, identifiable characteristics. Our intelligent buyer database can use these traits to identify highly suitable successors for your business with remarkable precision. In the initial step, potential buyers are informed anonymously about the latest acquisition opportunity. If there is continued interest from the buyer’s side, the company profile is provided with strict confidentiality, supported by a restrictive confidentiality agreement.
   
   3. Buyer Selection
   The search for potential buyers is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We take this burden off your shoulders and present only those candidates who demonstrate genuine interest and possess both the financial resources and professional expertise to successfully carry on your business.
   
   4. Negotiation
   To avoid dependency on any single buyer, we conduct parallel negotiations with multiple interested parties. We negotiate firmly, yet bring the necessary sensitivity thanks to our experience, allowing us to structure deals that create a win-win situation, even in seemingly deadlocked situations. So you can focus on day-to-day operations, we oversee the due diligence process, prepare the full contract documentation, and handle the nerve-wracking final negotiations to ensure the deal’s successful closing.
   
   5. Contract & Sale
   The sale of a company built with passion deserves solid legal protection. We draft purchase agreements specifically designed for SME sales. If needed, we have direct access to reputable M&A law firms. We also oversee the contract signing and ensure proper execution. Naturally, we remain available as trusted advisors for any questions after the sale.
